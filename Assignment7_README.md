Program 1 takes the number and type of dice "2d6", and a value within the possible sums of the roll as arguments
then it produces the probability of rolling that value or higher with the given dice.
it contatins a function def and some for and if statements


Program 2 takes a string as an argument
then produces all the different permutations of its letters in a list
this contains a function def, some if and for statements and is recursive. This allows it to run its course no matter the length of the string.
