Program 1 takes 3 or more integers as input, 1 at a time, and finds the mean, median, and range
the program includes while, break, if, for, else, .append(), print(), round(), len(), str(), int(), .sort(), input(), 

Program 2 takes a cypher of decimal Values divided by spaces, either positive or negative.
If negative, makes positive and produces a character from that, if positive it gets its oct value represented like a int, and produces a character from that.
All in all, it should generate a phrase from the cypher.

I could make program 2 better, if the instructions were clearer. I could not have had a harder time trying to understand what it was trying to convey.
