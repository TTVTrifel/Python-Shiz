# Python-Shiz
The first program is for finding either the GCF or LCM of two integers, the second is for finding the occurances of a character in a given passage

the first program takes two integers as input as well as a continue or stop input
the second program takes a passage input and a character input as well as a continue or stop input

the expected outcome of the first program is eithe the GCF or the LCM, while the second program is for figuring out what the occurances of a character
my programs use while and if statements
I could probably have organized the while statements better.
