Program 1 tells the user what integers between 2 and the integer they choose are prime
this program takes an int as input
should print all numbers that are prime
uses if and for statements
could be put in an array

Program 2 produces a Pascal Triangle with as many rows as the user requests
The program takes an int representing how many rows the user wants as input
should print rows of array values in the shape of a triangle
could probably be cleaned up a bit
