The First program was made to take 2 ints and then spit out either the LCM or GCF of the 2 depending on another input from the user.
It utilizes While, Try/Except, and If statements
I changed the orginal to be more picky and responsive to the user depending on whether their input was valid.
This makes it a million times easier to understand and use.

The Second program was made to take a passage over 200 words and a letter
as seperate inputs and then count the number of times that letter occured in the passage

It utilizes While, Try/Except, If, and .count()

This shortens the code significantly through the use of count, instead of manually counting with for.
I also made the program more responsive to bad input, so it will require the user to reenter a valid input for all the inputs.
